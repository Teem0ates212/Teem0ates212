- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teem0ates212
- 👀 I’m interested in extinguishing greed enabled motivating arbitrors for that which should be commone knowledge and public record....
- 🌱 I’m currently learning writing source code and editing standard liscences ReadME files into guilt based motivators for sharing freely. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything i find intriguing and allows me the pleasure of researching topics myself and rely less of social norms and social public knowledge sources. 
- 📫 How to reach me thru my oulook address unless i have the displeasure of hearing my phone ring, (thats how i know i let you too close) but if you can call me then youve got me anyhow.
